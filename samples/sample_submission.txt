Tackling Climate Change: An Analysis of Current Mitigation Strategies

Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, demanding immediate and coordinated action from governments, industries, and individuals alike. While the problem is well-documented, the solutions remain a subject of intense debate. This essay examines three prominent mitigation strategies — renewable energy transition, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and reforestation — evaluating their effectiveness, feasibility, and limitations.

The transition to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power stands as perhaps the most widely advocated solution. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2023), renewable energy capacity grew by 50% in 2023, with solar power leading the charge. The appeal is clear: replacing fossil fuels with clean alternatives directly reduces carbon emissions at the source. However, challenges persist. Intermittency remains a significant barrier, as solar and wind generation depends on weather conditions. Energy storage technology, while improving, has not yet reached the scale needed to fully compensate for this variability. Additionally, the initial infrastructure investment is substantial, though long-term operational costs are considerably lower than fossil fuel alternatives.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology offers a complementary approach by removing CO2 directly from industrial emissions or the atmosphere. The Global CCS Institute (2023) reports that over 30 commercial CCS facilities are now operational worldwide. CCS is particularly valuable for hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as cement and steel manufacturing, where electrification is not yet practical. Critics, however, point to the high cost per ton of captured carbon and the energy requirements of the capture process itself. There are also concerns about long-term storage integrity — the risk that stored CO2 could eventually leak back into the atmosphere. Despite these drawbacks, CCS technology continues to advance, and many climate models include it as a necessary component of achieving net-zero emissions.

Reforestation and afforestation represent a nature-based solution that has gained considerable attention. The Bonn Challenge, for example, aims to restore 350 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. Trees naturally absorb CO2 through photosynthesis, making large-scale planting an intuitive approach. A study published in Nature (Bastin et al., 2019) estimated that global tree planting could capture up to 205 gigatons of carbon. However, this figure has been disputed, with subsequent research suggesting the actual potential is significantly lower when accounting for factors like land availability, biodiversity concerns, and the time required for trees to mature. Furthermore, reforestation alone cannot offset the current rate of emissions — it must be paired with active emissions reduction.

Comparing these three strategies reveals that no single solution is sufficient. Renewable energy addresses emissions at the source but requires massive infrastructure changes. CCS provides a bridge for industries that cannot easily electrify but remains expensive and limited in scale. Reforestation offers ecological co-benefits but operates on longer timescales and has limited absorptive capacity relative to current emissions levels.

Given these considerations, a portfolio approach is recommended. Governments should prioritize rapid renewable energy deployment while investing in CCS research to bring costs down. Simultaneously, ambitious reforestation programs should be pursued for their climate and biodiversity benefits. As the IPCC (2022) emphasizes, limiting warming to 1.5°C requires "rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society." Only by combining technological innovation with nature-based solutions can we hope to meet this challenge.
